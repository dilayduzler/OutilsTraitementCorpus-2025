At Two Hearts, if the condition "EnterPierre's General Storewhen Abigail is there, any day except Saturday." is met, the event is as follows: You enter Abigail's room and watch her get angry about a videogame. She asks for your help, and you play the console version of Journey of the Prairie King together. (This is just like the arcade version in the Stardrop Saloon , except that Abigail plays a second character and actively helps you). When you finish the level, she thanks you and the cutscene ends. If you fail, however, she will still thank you for trying. You can't gain or lose friendship points during this heart event.
