She takes you into her private workshop to show you a robot she built to help her parents. She calls it MarILDA, short for Maru's Interactive Laboratory Device Alpha . She tells you she's been working on it for months, and has been waiting for you to come by before activating MarILDA. She activates the robot, who says \"Greetings, Maru. No need to respond... I have already predicted what you will say.\" Demetrius comes in to see what you two are up to. He sees the robot and becomes frightened. Maru tells him not to be scared and that MarILDA is her latest invention. The robot greets him, but Demetrius is upset. \"This is why you've locked yourself in your room the last few months? ...and I thought you were down here fooling around with <your name>...\" Maru says she's been making this robot to help Demetrius and Robin when she's not living with them anymore. MarILDA interrupts: \"Excuse me... I am sorry, Maru. But I do not want to be your servant... In the time since you activated me, I have been pondering the nature of my existence with the 'self-awareness' module you installed in my neural cortex. I am sorry to disappoint you all, but I must ask for my freedom. I've decided to explore the galaxy in search of other synthetic life-forms.\" Maru is startled and asks her to wait, but Demetrius says it's OK to let MarILDA go free. \"Your mother and I can take care of ourselves. I know you're ready to start a life of your own, and I've come to terms with the thought of not having you around anymore. Besides, this... creation of yours seems pretty advanced. It wouldn't feel right to keep her as a servant. <your name>, I'm sorry I mistrusted you. You're a < good guy or fine young woman >. I've never seen Maru so lively and creative... and I've never been more proud of her. If you've had a hand in that, then you have my gratitude.\" He leaves the room. Maru walks MarILDA outside. MarILDA thanks Maru for creating her and blasts off into space. Maru watches her go and asks what you think. \"I'm so impressed with your inventions.\" (+50 friendship .) Maru responds: \"Thanks. That means a lot to me, <your name>. I know gadgets aren't really your kind of thing... but I do appreciate that you're showing interest in what I do. I wish I could return the favor somehow.\" \"I'm disappointed... you should have made that robot your slave.\" (-50 friendship .) Maru responds: \"What? After she said point-blank that she doesn't want to be a slave? How cold... You must have a good reason for saying that...\" \"MarILDA's just a piece of machinery designed to act human.\" (+50 friendship .) Maru responds: \"... You have a point, I did program her to act human... but her neural net is so complex, I can't be sure conciousness didn't emerge on its own. Furthermore, isn't it a little arrogant to assume that human-like consciousness is the only worthwhile vessel of existence? Computer brains are different than ours, but that doesn't mean we can disregard them.\" She thanks you for coming by and leaves. \"I was just kidding. MarILDA deserves her freedom.\" (+50 friendship .) Maru responds: \"I see. Well it wasn't a very funny joke.\" She thanks you for coming by and leaves. \"I would've put her to work on the farm.\" (-50 friendship .) Maru responds: \"That's horrible! What's gotten into you, <your name>? I'm just going to forget about this conversation... you aren't acting yourself.\" She thanks you for coming by and leaves. \"So is your Dad okay with 'us' now?\" (No effect on friendship .)

He catches it successfully, then examines the frog worriedly; his leg is too injured.

Sebastian responds based on your choice (teasing you if you say the frog is their son), then he decides to take the frog home with him. Enter your farmhouse between 6:20am and 7pm the next day to trigger the next part of the event: Sebastian has replaced his Solarion Chronicles table with a terrarium in his spouse room. He explains that he made the terrarium for the frog, since it couldn't survive in the wild anymore. He's pleased that the frog is in better health, but wonders if it will be lonely. You can respond to him here: \"Why not start a 'frog sanctuary'?\" (No effect on friendship .) \"He’ll be fine.\" (No effect on friendship .) Choosing the frog sanctuary option makes him enthusiastic about making a haven for frogs, while the latter option has him agree, but still wish the frog had a friend.

If you ask him why he likes frogs, he tells you that he gained a natural affinity for frogs from being out in the rain. If you congratulate him on his new hobby, he enthuses about having a physical hobby and says he might even consider frog breeding.
