At Fourteen Hearts, if the condition "Enter theBackwoodsbetween 6:10am and 5pm." is met, the event is as follows: The player is foraging in bushes as a monster appears from a bush. It attacks the player and the player collapses. Abigail appears and kills the monster. She asks if the player is okay and says "I've never taken a life before." Monster Grave It's sad, but there was no other option. (No effect on friendship .) Abigail responds "Yeah... I did what I had to do. I guess the world's a pretty tough place. It was either you or him, right?" Monsters don't deserve our sympathy! (No effect on friendship .) Abigail responds "...Aren't they just trying to survive, like us? They may be our enemies, but I still think they deserve sympathy. Still... I did what had to be done." It's a harsh world, kid. (No effect on friendship .) Abigail responds "Huh? That's pretty funny coming from someone who just got rescued... But... yeah... Sometimes reality forces us to do things we'd rather not... Guess I'm learning that the hard way." Did you have to kill him? (No effect on friendship .) Abigail responds "Hey! I saved your life, didn't I? Maybe you should think about that instead of putting me on a guilt trip." Abigail warns the player to be more careful in the future, saying "I don't want to lose you." Then, she buries the monster and marks the grave with the symbol of Yoba . 
Interacting with the grave displays the text: "Abigail took a life to save mine...I'll never forget that." If you go home and talk to Abigail the same day as the event she'll say: "Good thing I brought my sword today!"
