abigail loves the following gifts: Amethyst (A purple variant of quartz.), Banana Pudding (A creamy dessert with a wonderful tropical flavor.), Blackberry Cobbler (There's nothing quite like it.), Chocolate Cake (Rich and moist with a thick fudge icing.), Monster Compendium (Monsters have a small chance to drop double loot.), Pufferfish (Inflates when threatened.), Pumpkin (A fall favorite, grown for its crunchy seeds and delicately flavored flesh. As a bonus, the hollow shell can be carved into a festive decoration.), Spicy Eel (It's really spicy! Be careful.).
