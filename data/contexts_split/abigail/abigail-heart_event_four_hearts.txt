At Four Hearts, if the condition "Visitthe mountainbetween noon and 7pm on a rainy day, any season except Winter." is met, the event is as follows: You see Abigail playing her flute. She asks what you're doing out in the rain. "Just doing some work." (No effect on friendship .) "Enjoying the weather." (+50 friendship .) "I could ask you the same question." (+10 friendship .) Regardless of your response, she invites you to stand under the tree with her. You pull out a lyre (Abigail calls it "a mini harp!") and you play a duet as the camera pans out over the lake. Note that if the player has cut down the tree near the mountain lake it will not be present during the 4 heart event, but Abigail will still reference the tree during the dialogue.
