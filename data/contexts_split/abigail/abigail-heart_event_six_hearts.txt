At Six Hearts, if the condition "Between 9pm and midnight on a day when it is not raining, enterPelican Townfrom any direction. (This includes exiting homes or shops in Town.)" is met, the event is as follows: Abigail is in the graveyard. She tells you that she's been practicing with her sword because she wants to go on adventures. She asks if you've ever used a sword. "Yes, and it's exciting!" (+10 friendship .) "Yes, but only in self-defense." (+10 friendship .) "Yes, but it's dangerous. You should stay safe." (-100 friendship .) "No." (No effect on friendship .) Pierre arrives and interrupts to say that Caroline wants her to come help cook dinner. Abigail gets angry, saying they only expect her to help cook because she's a girl. She flees, calling for you to follow. You both hide in some bushes and talk. After talking she will ask you to help her untangle her hair from a bush, and the cutscene ends.
